## General Info
This project is my final project for CS50x (Harvard University's Intro to Computer Science hosted on edX.org)

The main purpose is to make creating playlists from my personal music library faster, easier, and better by using the track lists of many of the fantastic playlists that are already hosted on Spotify.

Video Demo: TODO #7

## Technologies
Spotipylist uses the following:
- Python 3.6 or later
- spotipy 2.19.0
- rapidfuzz 1.5.0

## Setup
TODO #5

## Usage
TODO #6

## License
Spotipylist is licensed under the MIT license. 

This is one reason for using the rapidfuzz library over fuzzywuzzy as fuzzywuzzy is licensed under GPL-2.0, which would require Spotipylist to adopt GPL-2.0 as well.
